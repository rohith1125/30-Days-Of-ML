- count, shows how many rows have non-missing values.

Missing values arise for many reasons. For example, the size of the 2nd bedroom wouldn't be collected when surveying a 1 bedroom house. We'll come back to the topic of missing data.


- mean, which is the average. Under that, std is the standard deviation, which measures how numerically spread out the values are.

- Std aka standard deviation, a quantity expressing by how much the members of a group differ from the mean value for the group.

- To interpret the min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max values, imagine sorting each column from lowest to highest value. The first (smallest) value is the min. If you go a quarter way through the list, you'll find a number that is bigger than 25% of the values and smaller than 75% of the values. That is the 25% value (pronounced "25th percentile"). The 50th and 75th percentiles are defined analogously, and the max is the largest number.
